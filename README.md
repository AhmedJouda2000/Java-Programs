# Java-Programs
A collection of basic Java programs I wrote as part of my university modules.

## Running the programs
- I used the IDE [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) to write and run these programs alongside [Java 13.](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html)

## Acknowledgements
